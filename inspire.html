    <h2>What do you need to inspire someone?</h2>
    <p>To be able to inspire someone it takes many things or even a few. To have the trust between each other, Being yourself, Creating a motivating environment.</p>
    <p>Personally I believe to inspire someone you need to be able to find something similar between each other. Enough that it makes you wanna push yourself to be better or more.</p>
